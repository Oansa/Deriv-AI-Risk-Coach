🚨 **The Problem**

Most retail traders don’t lose because markets are impossible to predict — they lose because of behavior.

Overtrading

Martingale misuse

Emotional decisions after losses

Bots deployed without risk control

These patterns lead to blown accounts and poor learning outcomes.

💡 **The Solution**

Deriv AI Risk Coach is a behavioral intelligence layer for trading.

Instead of predicting prices, it:

Monitors trading activity in real time

Detects risky patterns and emotional behavior

Warns users before damage happens

Explains trades in simple, actionable language

The goal is safer trading, better learning, and improved long-term success.
